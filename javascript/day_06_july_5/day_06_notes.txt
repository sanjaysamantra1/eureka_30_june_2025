Functions
=========
1. Pre-Defined : console.log(), window.alert(), Math.max()
2. User Defined : we have to write the functions and use them
   a. Function Declaration
   b. Function Expression  
   c. Self Invoked (IIFE)
   d. Arrow Function


Function Declaration Vs Function Expression
===========================================
1. Function Declarations are named function, Function Expressions are anonymous
2. Function Declarations are hoisted, Function Expressions are not hoisted

Self Invoked
============
-Immediately Invoked Function Expression
-To invoke a block of code only 1 time 
-IIFEs cann't be invoked more than 1


Arrow Function
==============
-ECMAScript_6   2015
-Concise syntax
-implicit return
-Lexical Scoping 
-No 'this' binding
-Better for callback function


arr.map(function incrementBy5(val) {
    return val + 5;
});

Higher Order Function
=====================
-A function that takes another function as argument, is called Higher Order Function
-From the above example, map() is a higher order function

CallBack Function
=================
-A function that is used as argument inside another function is called callback function
-From the above example, incrementBy5 is callback function


How 'this' works in regular function and arrow function
=======================================================
1. Regular functions have their own 'this' binding, 
   Arrow Functions don't have their own 'this' , they use 'this' from lexical(the place where arrow function is declared / outer) scope

2. Regular Function : this (How/where the function is called)
   Arrow Function : this (Where the function is written)

3. 'this' inside arrow function is static
   'this' inside regular function is dynamic


Arrow Function Limitations
===========================
-Don't use arrow functions inside object literals.
-inside a function if we want 'this' value to be dynamic, don't use arrow function


Where Arrow functions should be used over regular functions
==========================================================
1. when used as callback function
