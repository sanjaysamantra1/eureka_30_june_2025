Array Copy
==========
let arr1 = [10, 20];
let arr2 = arr1;  // address/reference copy ( Not value copy)
-A new array is not being created, rather same address is being assigned to arr2
-Both arr1 & arr2 are holding the same address

let arr1 = [10, 20, [30, 31]];
let arr2 = [...arr1]; // value copy - shallow copy

let arr3 = [10, 20, [30, 31]];
let arr4 = structuredClone(arr3); // value copy - Deep Copy

-A shallow copy of an array is a copy whose nested elements share the same references.
 (Nested arrays will not be copied by value)
-A deep copy of an array is a copy whose nested elements do not share the same references.
